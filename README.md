# Bank Customers Churn Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict the churn (customer exits) in a bank based on various features. The prediction is done using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `Churn_Modelling.csv`. It contains information about bank customers, including features such as credit score, age, tenure, balance, number of products, etc.

## Project Files

- `Bank Customers Churn Prediction Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- `Churn_Modelling.csv`: Dataset file used in the project.

## Machine Learning Models

The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
